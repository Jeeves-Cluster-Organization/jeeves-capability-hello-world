"""
Hello World Chatbot Orchestration.

Simple service wrapper for running the 3-agent chatbot pipeline.

For hello-world, we keep the orchestration minimal. The service.py file
can be adapted or replaced with a simpler version for the chatbot.

Note: The service.py file here is from code-analysis and may need adaptation
for the general chatbot use case. See the plan for creating a simple
ChatbotService.

# Service will be created/adapted later
# For now, this module is a placeholder
